##Overview

This module populates `/etc/motd` on POSIX systems, and a registry key in Windows Systems with the contents of a simple template file.

##Module Description

The MOTD module demonstrates how to utilize templates within a module class and provides a means with which to experiment with the puppet module tool.

##Setup

###Beginning with the motd module
To configure motd on your system, include the `motd` class: `include motd`.

##Usage

The motd module configures the message of the day on a wide variety of systems. By default, the module will populate motd using the included template, however you can specify a different template or a static string. For example, to use a custom template you would set the template parameter:

~~~
class { 'motd':
  template => 'mymodule/mytemplate.erb',
}
~~~

The `legalnoticetext` registry key is shown before login on a Windows system.

##Development

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the huge number of platforms and myriad hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things. For more information, see our [module contribution guide.](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/forge/contributing.html)
